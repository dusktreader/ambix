alembic history cleaning tool

The ambix tool is intended to be used to clean up alembic histories. It can

also delete a migration with a specific revision.

The ambix tool is able to re-write your alembic python scripts and delete them.
Use mindfully, and make sure that you have used version control or some other
mechanism to backup your migration folder before you use ambix.
